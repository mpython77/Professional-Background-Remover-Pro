Professional Background Remover Pro
Overview
Professional Background Remover Pro is a Python-based desktop application designed to remove backgrounds from images effortlessly. Built using the rembg library and a user-friendly GUI with tkinter, this tool offers a variety of image editing features such as cropping, rotating, flipping, zooming, and batch processing. It supports multiple image formats (PNG, JPEG, etc.) and includes an undo functionality for easy editing.

The application is ideal for users who need a quick and efficient way to process images without relying on complex software like Photoshop.
